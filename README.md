Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: How did features of voters in each racial group change?
+ This project is conducted by Siran Qiu

+ Project summary: [a short summary] LFirst, I looked into the wordcloud of 2020 questionnaire question to decide my main topic--race and then I processed the time series data from 1968 to 2020 to see how the way of each racial group voting changed.
